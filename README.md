🍕 Exciting Update: Analyzing Pizza Sales using SQL and Power BI 📊
I'm thrilled to share the latest project I've been working on – a deep dive into the world of pizza sales! 💼
In this project, I took a delicious dataset and transformed it into actionable insights that would make any pizza lover proud. Here's a sneak peek into what I accomplished:

📂 Data Management: To begin with, I employed SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to seamlessly transfer the data into an SQL database using a flat file export method. This strategic step enabled me to effectively structure and oversee the data, laying the groundwork for a thorough and in-depth analysis.

🔍 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Using SQL queries, I extracted essential KPIs that illuminated critical aspects of the pizza sales landscape. These insights helped paint a clear picture of the business. Also made a report for showcasing my findings to non-technical audience.

📊 Power BI Magic: The real fun began when I connected the SQL database to Power BI. With its dynamic capabilities, I crafted interactive reports that not only told the story of our pizza sales but allowed users to explore the data themselves.

🍕 Why Pizza? You might wonder why I chose pizza for this project. Well, it's a universally loved food, and who can resist the allure of pepperoni vs. pineapple debates? 🤷‍♂️ Plus, it's a fantastic way to showcase how data analysis can elevate decision-making in any industry.

Throught this project we were able to answer these question:
KPI's -
1. Total Revenue Generated
2. Average Order Value
3. Total Pizzas Sold
4. Total Order Placed
5. Average Pizzas Per Order
Trends -
1. Daily & Monthly Trends for Total Orders
2. % of sales by Pizza Category & Size
3. Total Pizzas Sold by Category
Best vs Worst Sellers -
1. Top & Bottom 5 pizzas by Revenue
2. Top & Bottom 5 pizzas by Quantity sold
3. Top & Bottom 5 pizzas by Total Orders

🚀 I'm excited to bring this project to life and continue exploring the endless possibilities of data-driven insights.
